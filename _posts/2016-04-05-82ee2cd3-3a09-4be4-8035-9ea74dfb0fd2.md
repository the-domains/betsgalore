_**Champions League Betting: Tue. 05 Apr**_

**19.45 Barcelona v Atletico Madrid**

Any team coming up against a trio like Messi, Suarez and Neymar would be forgiven for shaking in their boots. The Barcelona dominance has been magnificent this season, 39 games unbeaten which finally came to an end last week at the hands of rivals Real Madrid. However in Atletico, we have probably one of the few sides that could actually cope with the Barca firepower. Diego Simeone will be well aware that Atletico have the ability to soak up the Barca attack and hit them on the counter and he will definitely be packing the defense tonight. They knocked Barca out of the Champions League two years ago and although I think the Catalan giants will prevail over two legs, I think its will be a close affair.

**20.45 Bayern Munich v Benfica**

This one is simple enough, it's German dominance at its most powerful here tonight. Bayern are almost invincible at home, they have won all 4 fixtures at home and have amassed an aggregate score of 14-1 over the four games. Robert Lewandowski is in red hot form, 44 goals in 47 games for club and country so you can see where I heading on the betting markets.
